## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

- ✅ **Physical pentesting**: Clone HID badges at a door with Flipper RFID module
- ✅ **IR hijacking**: Replay IR signals to open garage doors or turn off TVs in public spaces
- ✅ **Wi-Fi deauth demos**: Knock selected clients off a guest network to simulate rogue AP behavior
- ✅ **Bluetooth spoofing**: Imitate common BLE beacons for misdirection
- ✅ **Security awareness**: Defensive mode runs “harmless but noisy” payloads for red team exercises
